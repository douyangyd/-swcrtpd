# SW-CRT Power Distribution R Package

For now, the code is not well-documented and should be used at your own risk. Please note the computational time is excessive on your local computer.

We delay the documentation as we are developing an R package for efficiently evaluate attained power and pre-randomization power distribution on local computers for continuous, binary, and count outcomes.
We are still working on the code for the R package. **A well-documented R package should be available in Aug/Sep 2020.** Please check back then.
